# Clojure Full-stack Example 1

## Introduction

I decided to create this Clojure full-stack example to update my previous Clojure full-stack exercise, [re-frame-demo](https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/re-frame-demo), which I actually created mostly for learning [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame).

This new Clojure Full-stack Example 1 has two purposes:

1. A better and smoother UI for the web-store application example, and also better edn based contract between the backend and the frontend.
2. Provide an application that I can later on use to experiment various deployment possibilities in AWS, Azure and GCP.

I also wanted to get rid of the various backend data stores that I used in the previous exercise, and just use Postgres.
